# CFD Data Post-process
Post-Processing data using python and tecplot, mainly for CFD results from INCA. This program includes the following features:

* Convert data format from **tecplot** *.plt/.szplt* to **phthon pandas** *.h5*, or the other way around.
* Compute basic flow parameters, like **Reynolds number**, **boundary layer thickness**, **viscosity**, **y+**, **enstrophy**, and so on.
